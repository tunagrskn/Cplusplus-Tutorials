Program: We will write a program that calculates the cost for a rental car trip. We have to pay 0.5 TL
for each kilometer we drove the car. We also have to pay 5 TL for each day we rented the car. We have
to pay 15% tax for the summed kilometer and daily payment.
Ex: Please enter the initial kilometer reading=1000
Please enter the final kilometer reading=1500
Please enter the number of days you rented the car=4
You travelled 500 kilometers during 4 days
Your distance cost =250
Your daily cost =20
Your cost before tax =270
Your tax amount =40.5
Your total cost =310.5

	cout<<"Your total cost "<<float((d*5)+(0.5*z))*0.15 + ((d*5)+(0.5*z))<<endl;
	return 0;
